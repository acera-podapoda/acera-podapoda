I'm Acera Podapoda. I occasionally code in HTML, CSS, and (very rarely) JavaScript.
I also draw, drink coffee, and make VRoid models. One day, I will put (some of) these models up for download.
I don't take commissions, but it usually takes me about an hour and a half to finish a drawing. I don't time myself when I make VRoid models, so I don't know how long it takes me.
